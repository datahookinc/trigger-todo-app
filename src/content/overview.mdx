# Overview

Welcome to **Trigger**!

**Trigger** is a `data-oriented` state management system developed for React and TypeScript. **Trigger** is lightweight, with
0 dependencies, and is designed to optimize the developer experience for working with data in your application.

**Trigger** borrows philosophies and design patterns from database management (e.g., INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE, triggers, transactions, etc.); however, it also
borrows design patterns from other popular state management systems to maximize your productivity.
